A team that believes in humans working together and creating awesome ideas that people can use. I don't believe in Zombies. I like pizza; Even before software development.\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\n* **Twitter**: [@techsmut](http://www.twitter.com/techsmut)\r\n* **Coder Wall**: [coderwall](https://coderwall.com/jbwilmoth)\r\n\r\n### Programming\r\n```ruby\r\n  def skills {\r\n      :programming_languages  => [Ruby],\r\n      :development_frameworks => [Sinatra, Rails],\r\n      :database               => [MySQL, postgreSQL, sqlite3],\r\n      :testing                => [RSpec, Shoulda, Cucumber, Capybara],    \r\n      :orms                   => [ActiveRecord],\r\n      :front_end              => [Javascript, HTML, CSS],\r\n      :version_control        => [Git],\r\n      :app_servers            => [Thin, Unicorn]\r\n    }\r\n  end\r\n```","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
